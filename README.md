# SignUp Checker
- This program takes a URL for a Signup Genius page, then collects all the slots in the page. It can then be pasted into a spreadsheet. 
- Or, it takes a bunch of links out of the clipboard. It assumes two columns in the list: name, and URL. It then creates a separate Excel file for each with the entries in the Signup Genius.
